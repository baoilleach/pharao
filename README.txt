Pharao was a pharmacophore alignment problem developed by Silicos IT. It has since been renamed to Align-IT.

This set of patches to Silicos IT's Pharao is not maintained by me, but is provided here as a service for future developers.

There's no point filing issues here as I'm not maintaining this. I just checked in the code in 2011 and applied some patches for problems I identified. At that time, Silicos IT was already gone or not responsive or something (I don't remember the details at this point). Since then, I believe that Pharao has been renamed to Align-IT. I don't know if the problems identified in these patches was addressed.

The following is the content of the original README:

- Compilation and installation instructions are described in the 'INSTALL.txt' file.
- Documentation on the use of PHARAO is available in the doc/ directory.
